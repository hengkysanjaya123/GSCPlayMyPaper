## Developer Student Clubs [DSC] Solution Challenge 2020

# PlayMyPaper
Music can be fairly difficult to learn and make, with the ability to create music having a relatively high learning curve. 
Our platform provides: 
- A feature for people to play music sheets without the need for an actual instrument to manually play the notes to have a basic understanding of how the music is being played out. 
- Virtual Piano Simulation that plays music so that it helps people to learn and understand music from the real animation. People are also able to play simultaneously with the system.
- Last but not least, a community platform for people who interested in music to discuss and share their awesome ideas to fellow friends.
